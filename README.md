# Building a CNN model with men-women dataset

## Overview

- Classification images
- Build a ``CNN`` model
- Calculate Loss,accuracy
- The codes are in ``men-women.ipynb`` as a notebook
- I used ``men-women classification`` dataset from kaggle

- I saved model structure in ``model_conf.json``

## Challenge

- During training, the model showed signs of **overfitting**.  
This means the model performed well on the training data but its accuracy on validation/test data decreased.  
To address this issue, techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and regularization can be considered in future improvements.

## Tips

- To work with the dataset, we need to create the following structure:
